## Web Literacy and #CritLib

5/5/15

_What is my responsibility when it comes to technology? Why is web literacy important? How does my knowledge of technology and technology issues affect my role? How do I use my role to leverage change that is positive to the people I serve? How do I talk about my values and ideas with those resistant to  them?_

I am an academic librarian. I'm relatively new to the profession- meaning that although I've worked in libraries for the past 9 years, I have only been a _Librarian_ since August. As a paraprofessional, I was not privy to the kind of decision-making that drives the way a library serves its patrons. Some day, I may write a long post about the difference between library worker and librarian, but suffice it to say that there _is_ a very real difference in the power of my current role compared to my former roles. And the more I think about my role, the more I challenge myself to be sure that I am making the most of it.

Over the past few months, I have been helping to define [web literacy](https://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-whitepaper/ "Mozilla Webmaker Whitepaper on Web Literacy"), a concept coined by the [Mozilla Webmaker community](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webmaker/WebLiteracyMap "Webmaker Web Literacy Wiki") which boils down to _the ability to read, write and participate on the web_. This is an important project because currenty there is a lack of emphasis in Information Literacy and pedagogy on teaching about the web and the internet. Undoubtedly, many people aren't able to explain the difference between the web and the internet, but the implications are huge when it comes to discussing privacy &amp; encryption, access to information, and many other issues at the fore of politics today. Implications brought about and reinforced by capitalism, government control, and social ineqities.

There are numerous global initiatives to change the way that communication on the web is carried out. We have covert, quasi-legal government operations to [undermine security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29 "Wikipedia entry on PRISM (surveillance program)"). We have [proposed legislation](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/04/30/irate-congressman-gives-cops-easy-rule-just-follow-the-damn-constitution/ "Ars Technica - Irate Congressman gives cops easy rule: 'just follow the damn Constitution'") to do the same. We also have proposed legislation to allow coporations who own the infrastructure to [dictate what information can pass to which customers](https://www.eff.org/issues/net-neutrality "EFF statement on net neutrality"). We are living at the brink of [dystopia](http://www.dystopiatracker.com/E "Dystopia Tracker").

I don't expect all librarians to get as excited about this as me. I don't expect all librarians to become experts on the history, sociology and politics of the internet. But as librarians, we have some responsibilities to our communities. I think this quote does a good job of summing it up:

> "The core ethics and values of the information disciplines and professions require that we steward, validate, protect, and also liberate the cultural and documentary record; that we insure that documentation is transparent and accountable; and that we provide equitable and ready access to information for all."

>From: the [Statement from Information Studies Academics and Professionals on Documentary Evidence and Social Justice](http://criticallis.com/"").

However, this leaves out one very imporatant aspect of information literacy- the ability to be an active _participant_ in _contributing_ to the documentation. It is not enough for us to preserve and make information available- we need to ensure that the _use_ of that information is open to all. To use information in the 21st century includes being able to synthesize that information and create new ideas.

As the web becomes increasingly at the center of the storing and sharing of this documentation, we need to be sure that people not only have access to information, but that they have the ability to contribute to that information. The web is not static. It is not a one-way communication tool. The revolutionary aspect of the web is that it allows for collaboration and participation. From posting on social media to creating websites, people create and share information in ways that was not possible before the web.

The implications of this collaborative community are far-reaching and affect many areas of our lives. It puts power into the hands of the many. It allows anyone with the infrastructure and skills to question and challenge the traditional role of the 'expert' and 'authority.' Photos, videos and microblogs have helped bring the concept of #BlackLivesMatter to the fore of the national conversations. People can now easily share information that debunks corporate news and government press releases. The web allows more voices to be heard. But it isn't automatic- people still need the technology and the know-how.

But how can librarians work toward this goal?

### The #CritLib lens

\#CritLib is a set of Twitter meetings arranged around issues that beg for critical evaluations and perspectives:

>"Recognizing that we all work under regimes of white supremacy, capitalism, and a range of structural inequalities, how can our work as librarians intervene in and disrupt those systems?"

>[#CritLib chats cheat sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wntzuezo-QVhl7pgf3HJQ2iIUgUrs8E61hU1gdAbSSc/edit "#critlib Google Doc")

Past topics include: educational technology &amp; neoliberalism, [anti-oppressive facilitation strategies](https://storify.com/oksveta/critlib-4-21-2015 "4/21/15 #critlib Storify"), and critical pedagogy. The recommended readings are thought-provoking and the discussions bring out a variety of perspectives and stories. It's not so much a place to go for crucial information and action steps as it is a place to share and be heard. Libraries are constantly changing and are being disrupted. It's useful to think about how we can guide those changes to be disruptions for dismantling the status quo. My experience with these chats is largely my inspiration for writing about the topic of web literacy for this post.

### Open Web Fluency &amp; Leadership

Recently a new Mozilla Webmaker community group ([Open Web Fluency?](http://www.zythepsary.com/techie/open-fluency/ "Zythepsary post about the Open Fluency community calls")) has arisen that is focused on the leadership roles of those of us who participate in teaching web literacy (hence fluency). But there is also a focus on the [open web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Web "Wikipedia entry for Open Web") and in providing learners with empowerment and independence. Active learning also is at the fore of web literacy (more on that later).

<br>
### Active Learning &amp; the Web

>"There is only one subject-matter for education, and that is life in all of its manifestations."

>[-Alfred North Whitehead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_North_Whitehead "Wikipedia entry for Alfred North Whitehead")

The idea that people learn best when new information is coupled with active hands-on work isn't a new one. The idea that applying what has been learned to practical applications and real-life situations isn't any newer. In the context of the web, there is no better way to learn than to throw students at a project and let them explore independently and determine for themselves what areas to pursue. This is precisely what the Mozilla Webmaker clubs and Hive communities [seek to do](https://blog.webmaker.org/learning-through-making-the-best-kind-of-education?ref=050415_Claw&utm_campaign=050415_Claw&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=referral "Learning Through Making: The Best Kind of Education").

Active learning is built into the web. Anyone can learn HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript (the primary languages that make up the web) with any computer bought off the shelf. All that is needed is a text editor and a browser. [Free online courses](https://github.com/sometimesmotion/webliteracytools "Tools to Learn &amp; Teach the Web Github page") allow people to learn coding from almost any device connected to the web. Many services have free smartphone apps, such as Coursera, Codecademy and Khan Academy. The barrier to entry is very low, but a computer of some type is still required.

As a librarian, you don't need to know the content, you simply need to provide a space and guidance for people to learn on their own. Host a [Maker Party](https://party.webmaker.org/resources "Webmaker Maker Party Resources Page"), [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us "Hour of Code homepage"), or [Cryptoparty](https://www.cryptoparty.in/ "Cryptoparty homepage"). Reserve a computer lab or a bunch or laptops and promote your event. Engage your patrons and partners- do you know anyone who wants to share their passion about the web?

<br>
### Infrastructure

A big part of being able to contribute to the web is having access to the web. We all already know that libraries are one of the only places where people can get this access for free. Work to keep it that way. Filters and firewalls censor your patrons' voices and bar them from the conversations. The homeless guy who keeps looking at porn is no more of a reason for blocking internet access than a joyriding teen is a reason for barricading off certain streets. Yes, it's a difficult problem, but there are other solutions.

What is your library's presence on the web? Do you have a mobile-friendly webpage? Is the catalog mobile-friendly? More people have access to the web through smartphones than desktop computers or laptops. Blacks and Hispanics are [3 times more dependent](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/30/racial-and-ethnic-differences-in-how-people-use-mobile-technology/ "Pew Research Center - Racial and ethnic differences in how people use mobile technology") on their smartphones for internet access than whites. Blacks and Hispanics also use their phones for accessing educational content more often. Is your library's web presence making it more difficult or easier for people to access information?

Building an app? Make it useful on all devices and to all users. Making the decision to create iPhone-centered projects are deciding to create projects that are closed to certain users, whereas responsive [mobile-first design](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?933 "Luke Wroblewski's blog post about Mobile Design") provides equitable access across devices. Restricting wireless access with [passwords](https://openwireless.org/ "Openwireless.org homepage") is one more barrier, but checking out [wireless hotspots](http://hotspot.nypl.org/ "NYPL Library Hotspot program page") opens access to entire groups of people _outside the library_. Our programs and policies directly impact our communities' access to the web and ability to participate on the web.
